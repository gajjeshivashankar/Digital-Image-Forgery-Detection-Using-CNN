# Digital-Image-Forgery-Detection-Using-CNN
The rapid growth of digital imaging technology has facilitated the creation of 
manipulated images for various purposes, including deception, misinformation, and 
fraud. Detecting such forgeries is crucial for maintaining the integrity and credibility of 
digital content. This project aims to develop a robust digital image forgery detection 
application using advanced algorithm techniques. The proposed model utilizes 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced image processing algorithms to 
identify various types of image forgeries, such as copy-move, splicing, and retouching. 
By leveraging the power of deep learning, the system can automatically learn 
discriminative features from image data, enabling accurate detection of manipulated 
regions .
